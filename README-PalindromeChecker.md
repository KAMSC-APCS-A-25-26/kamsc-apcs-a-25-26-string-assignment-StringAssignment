# PalindromeChecker (Student Instructions)

## Goal
Build a simple program that reads a word and tells the user if it is a palindrome (the same forwards and backwards), case-insensitive.

## Requirements
- Read input with `Scanner.nextLine()`.
- Reverse the word by iterating from the end to the start.
- Print exactly one of the following:
  - `<word> is a palindrome!`
  - `<word> is NOT a palindrome.`

## Example
```
Enter a word: racecar
racecar is a palindrome!

Enter a word: hello
hello is NOT a palindrome.
```
